## Why C++

Out of all the modern programming languages why do we still use C++ for games?

* C++ is a lower level language and is more complex but has greater perfomance.  Games are very performance oriented so this is the language of choice for the engine.  Often higher level scripting languages are used for game play scripting. [Unity](https://answers.unity.com/questions/9675/is-unity-engine-written-in-monoc-or-c.html) game engine is written in c++ but you write all the game scripts in c#.

* Manual memory management which avoids any issues with higher level languages not freeing up memory, or freeing up so much that it affects the performance of the game.

* Easier to optimize heavily used routines

* There is a C++ compiler available for all platforms, so is beneficial if you want to support PC's, consoles and mobile.

* Many libaries such as Havok or Scaleform are written in C++.

* It is used extensively in lower level systems like rendering, audio and physics

* C++ is a compiled programming language 

* We will be using C++ 14 as this is supported by Unreal.

> Modern C++ Language Syntax
Unreal Engine is built to be massively portable to many C++ compilers, so we are careful to use features that are compatible with the compilers we might be supporting. Sometimes features are so useful that we will wrap them up in macros and use them pervasively. However, we usually wait until all of the compilers we might be supporting are up to the latest standard.<br><br>We are using many C++14 language features that seem to be well-supported across modern compilers, such as range-based-for, move semantics and lambdas with capture initializers. In some cases, we can wrap up usage of these features in preprocessor conditionals (such as rvalue references in containers). However, we might decide to avoid certain language features entirely, until we are confident we won't be surprised by the appearance of a new platform appearing that can't digest the syntax.<br><br>Unless specified below, as a modern C++ compiler feature we are supporting, you should not use compiler-specific language features unless they are wrapped in preprocessor macros or conditionals and used sparingly. - [UE4 Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CodingStandard#modernc++languagesyntax)
